Rendering
- Animate lights (position and color/intensity)
- Implement normal mapping
- Implement PBR
- Environment cubemap
 - Load cubemap from KTX
 - IBL: use environment texture to handle diffuse and reflections
- Separate the following data per frame in flight
 - ViewTransform buffer
 - Light block
 - Model transform descriptors
- Shadow maps
 - Requires separate render pass(es) so need to extract this part from RenderSurface
 - Requires separate pipeline so need to extract non-pipeline code from Pipeline class

Organizational
- Reduce main function size
- Use vk-bootstrap
- vulkan.h vs vulkan.hpp
- Type safe uniform buffer creation and mapping:
  - UniformBuffer<Thing> thingBuffer;
  - thingBuffer.data = Thing{};  // data is Thing&
  - UniformBufferArray<Thing> thingBuffer(3);
  - thingsBuffer.data[0] = Thing{};  // data is std::span<Thing>

Other
- gltf
- Build to web
- Separate presentation (swapchain) and rendering. Do not render directly to swapchain images. It's required to render in HDR.
