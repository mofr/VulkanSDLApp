Rendering
- Animate lights (position and color/intensity)
- Add sun light / point light distinction
- Implement normal mapping
- Implement PBR
- Environment cubemap
 - IBL: use environment texture to handle diffuse and reflections
- Separate the following data per frame in flight
 - Model transform descriptors
- Shadow maps
 - Requires separate render pass(es) so need to extract this part from RenderSurface
 - Requires separate pipeline so need to extract non-pipeline code from Pipeline class
- Particle systems (cpu/gpu compute)
- Reverse depth buffer

Organizational
- Reduce main function size
- Use vk-bootstrap

Other
- Use SDL_Vulkan_GetInstanceExtensions
- gltf
- Build to web
- Separate presentation (swapchain) and rendering. Do not render directly to swapchain images. It's required to render in HDR when display support only LDR.
- Sort by Z to reduce overdraw
